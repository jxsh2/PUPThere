For example, if you want to find the shortest path between the main gate and Oval, you can tell PUPThere to automatically calculate the optimal route using the A* algorithm. PUPThere is designed to save you time and effort by automating the process of finding the shortest path.

To use the app, start by entering the starting location and destination in the respective text boxes. Once you click on the starting location text box, a list of options of places will appear for you to choose from. Similarly, when you click on the destination text box, a list of options of places will appear."
